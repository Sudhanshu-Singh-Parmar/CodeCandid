# 🚀 CodeCandid  
**A Glass-Box Algorithm Learning, Simulation & AI-Assisted Education Platform**

> *See algorithms think. Ask them why.*

---

## 📌 Overview

**CodeCandid** is an interactive algorithm learning and simulation platform designed to make algorithms **transparent, explainable, and intuitive**.

Unlike traditional tools that treat algorithms as black boxes, CodeCandid follows a **glass-box learning approach**, exposing the **internal execution flow, decision points, and evolving states** of algorithms — step by step.

To further enhance learning, CodeCandid integrates an **AI-powered chatbot**, enabling learners to ask questions, clarify doubts, and receive contextual explanations during exploration.

## 🎯 Problem We Address

Learning algorithms is challenging because:

- Execution happens mentally or on paper  
- Internal states are hidden  
- Students memorize steps instead of understanding logic  
- Debugging recursion, DP, and graphs feels abstract  
- Learners often lack real-time guidance  

Most platforms focus on *outputs*, not *reasoning*.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

CodeCandid transforms algorithm learning into an **interactive, guided experience** by combining:

- Step-by-step visualization  
- State inspection and execution tracing  
- Mentor-style learning checkpoints  
- AI-assisted explanations and doubt resolution  

This approach enables learners to **observe, question, and understand** algorithms as they execute.
